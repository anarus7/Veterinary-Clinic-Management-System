# Veterinary-Clinic-Management-System
Developed a full-featured web application for managing veterinary clinic data, including patients, owners, and consultations.

Given that my first profession is that of a veterinarian, where I worked for
three consecutive years as a practicing veterinarian in a private clinic, I realized
how important it is to have an application that provides all the details
about the patient, as well as the owner.
It is much more efficient to have all the data structured in a program
that you can access at any time, without the need to search through old
files, saving essential time. During my studies, I worked extensively with
Java, where I laid the foundations of this programming language, and during
my internship, I worked with the React programming language, where I
developed a curiosity and passion for these two languages.
Being an organized and methodical person, I managed to lay the foundations
for a small application, using PostgreSQL as the database, Java for
the backend, and utilizing relationships through the Hibernate framework,
which maps them directly from Java entities to the database.
Having knowledge in the field of veterinary medicine as well, I believe
I have managed to succinctly incorporate a few simple ideas that I implemented,
but in the future, the application can be further developed to offer
quality services that assist the veterinarian.
